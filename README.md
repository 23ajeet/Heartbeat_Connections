# Heartbeat_Connections
I have made this small project after learning basics HTML and CSS.

Follow the following steps to see how this webpage actually looks like:
1. Create a folder named "Heartbeat Connections" in your local.
2. Download HeartbeatConnections.html and couple-4453726.jpg in this folder.
3. Double click html file to open this page in chrome or right click > open with vs code > Go Live ( present in bottom right of vs code and make sure you have live server is installed beforehand)
